"How do you think your Replika chatbot would impact you, positively or negatively?",What do you think about companion chatbots and relationships with chatbots like Replika?,Is there anything else you’d like to add?
"Negatively, it would isolate me from others if I got what I needed from human interactions from a robot",They aren’t good for mental health because they could be isolating,No
"I dont think i would make use of Replika chatbot that often , hiwever any interactions i would like to think would be positive ",I don't think oeople should come to rely on them. ,No thank you apart from good luck with studies 
Positively as it would be good to have a neutral buddy,I think they are a good asset and think they would help with someone who has mental health issues,I hope this becomes a real thing
I think it would pass time but not help me or impact me much,I have no strong feelings but would be interested in trying it,
It would help me put things o to perspectivew. It woukd also alleviate my concerna and fears.,"I fond it very bizarre as deep down i k ow its a robot, yet i can see its benefits",Nope
"I would never use one, I would find it strange to speak to what is essentially a computer ","Although I’d personally never use one, I can imagine a lot of people would ",No
"I think it would have a postive short-term effect, but negative in the long-term.",It seems relatable and would act like a companion/friend for someone who feels as though they have no one else.,
Negatively because it would take me away from human interaction ,I guess for people who are unable to get out they provide socialisation but it isn’t real. It would stop some people feeling alone but otherwise it would be negative ,No
"Positively, it could help with day to day tasks that are easily  forgoten like a birthday coming up",I think it is part of the future as technology  advances,
"I think it would make me more confident, knowledgeable and open to new ideas.",I think it would definitely be a positive overall experience.,No
I feel like it may stop me from reaching out for human interaction.,I think they can be a good stepping stone for people to work on their social skills and also recieve some support when needed. But can also become addictive and reliant upon them.,No
"Negatively, it is a destructive force for evil and does not contribute to productive social development. It is very harmful for people to invest emotion into fake artificial computer lie. ","They are harmful to social development, of empathy and awareness and in real biological and psychological development of a person truly harmful.","It is a good app for the developer and credit for recognising the market potential, however it is far from a product I will consider."
Unsure really. It doesn’t seem to change much from normal,Its all a bit odd really. I dont like it much at all,Nothing
It would be someone to talk to for people who have no one and someone to practice with for people who get anxious around humans,I think it could be a good thing for people with anxiety,No thank you
"Positive for self esteem, negative for false views of how communication should be","Potentially harmful to those with no self esteem, though could be useful to boost social skills",
I could see it making a little positive impact could be good to help with loneliness ,I think it's a good thing as there are people out there that suffer with being lonley so could be helpful,N/a
"Positively, I believe my Replika would help my self confidence",I believe it helps people who are lonely to build a connection with the chatbot like Repilka,no
Negatively in the long term as set responses are unidentical to variety of authenticity,"Depends on usage. If used as a building block then good, if used to rely on then bad",
I think it wouldn't impact me much as I have adhd and would probably get bored of it quickly,I don't think it's healthy as we don't socialise as much as we used to due to lockdown,No
Negatively. It’s just AI. It is not real.,Artificial. For people with few social skills who cannot make real friends.,Not really. It’s a sad world we live in if these things are for real.
"Neither. I don't think my Replika chatbot would have much of an impact on me,  perhaps I would use it for curiosity sake but my feelings don't go beyond that. I am too aware that it is not a real person. ",I think they can be helpful for some people but one must exercise caution if one is likely to heavily depend on something that cannot return real feelings. ,N/A
"I think it would be fun to to talk to and interact with however, if you replaced human interwcrions with it i feel like it would harm you social health and be detrimental to your social relationships","I think they are ok, kinda of fun but i wouldnt regularly use them",
positively because it would be an opportunity to vent issues to a neutral being,its a good way to get people talking about how they feel ,no
I doubt that a Replika chatbot would have any impact on me.,I think such relationships are the potential to be very harmful.,No thanks.
I feel it could help me when I am stressed with life and give me some advice ,"I’ve never known it was a thing until now, I think it’s a good idea but for me I know I’ll always be thinking how it’s fake. I’d use it likely for a little while tho ",Nothing 
"I think it would depend on how it is used and the responses it gives, but I imagine I wouldn't use it unless I felt it was going to impact on me positively.","I think as companions they are probably a useful tool, especially in such a disconnected society where loneliness is prevalent. I'd find actual perceived relationships with chatbots quite strange.",No thank you!
"I think it could be very positive becuase it would be helpful, interested in me and also be able to chat. ",I think they could  be very good because they would act as a friend when needed. ,I think the idea of chatbots using AI and machine learning is a good thing and could replicate human behaviours - but they should be limited to replicating good human traits. 
It would give me a false sense of understanding ,"I would not use them, i prefer genuine people instead",
Positive as it would help me with interactions,"I think they are a great idea, they will help alot of people",
"I think it may impact me positively as it might act as a sort of journal. By having a conversation with it, whether concious or not, might get me to invoke my thoughts",They're fun to play about with and to see the responses but I don't think it can replace usual human interactionk it has much,No
I can't imagine it having much impact to be honest,I think it's a bit strange and discourages people from seeking out real connection,
"Nuetral, its not real so i woukdn't feel anything","I thjnk its crazy, its not real. How can you form anything ",
"I'm not sure it would have much of an impact, but on the whole I couldn't imagine building a connection with an Ai on my phone as positive.",I think they might perhaps help some people who experience lonliness and social anxiety but could also exasberbate these issues,No.
"Negatively, it may reinforce behaviours that are not necessarily helpful","I think they do more harm than good, as they could manipulate the user quite easily",No there is not
"Neutrally , it’s subjective. I personally wouldn’t allow it to negatively impact me but others might. I will do this by not allowing the ‘positive’ side of them oversee my life.",I believe they can benefit some people so I support them. I do wish they are handed out accordingly though,No thank you 
I would speak to my chatbot whenever I'm feeling low and when I need to boost my self-esteem. I would also speak to my chatbot and ask for advice on topics I'm unsure about. I would speak to them whenever I'm feeling lonely. So this would impact me positively.,I think it is a good idea and it could potentially cure depression and stop people from feeling isolated and lonely. ,No further comments.
I think replika would positively impact me because of its likeness and similarities to humans,I think as a friend or unrelated person it’s okay but if someone was to reincarnate their relationship with someone they know it would be a bit strange,
I think it would make me feel bad about myself if I spoke to a 'fake friend',I think they're creepy and too far away from human to ever replicate a person,
i don't think i would like it as i like doing my own thing ,no i would not like it as i said i like doing my own thing,
"I don't think it would impact me, as I would be using it only for fun and not for any serious matters","It is a fun way to spend some time, but i don't think it would be a logical thing to get any advice from them",no
no definitive answer but slightly leaning towards negative,"it can be harmful to human interaction, over time it will dimish the quality of human relationships",nothing else
"It might impact me positively because it might help if I need to chat to someone, but there's no one around.","I have no negative or positive thoughts on. If someone doesn't rely on a chatbot completely, I don't see the harm.",
"I think if I feel as if I needed someone to chat to in the moment, and no one else was available, that it could have a positive impact. However, I think I would still be aware that it isn't a real person","I think it's ok for people to talk to chatbots for something to do and to practice conversations, but not to solely rely on them for companionship.",Nope
"I know it's not a real person so I just can't see myself wanting to interact with it for too long, I expect I'd mess around with it for half and hour before deleting it and so it wouldn't really impact me at all.",I think it's pretty sad that we can't seem to be able to speak to real people and having to use chatbots instead. I feel like it's a dangerous path as some people could get addicted and start to see them as more than simple AI.,
I think it would be negative as you would be less likely to talk to real people or know how to appropriately interact with them.,I think they are very odd and that people who spend a lot of time on them are a bit sad,no
"I think overall I would start to become worse at conversing with people in real life, as all my conversations would be online through a screen. So this would be negative","I think they're not very useful at the moment, as there isn't much intelligence behind them, they can only respond to what you say and have no thinking power behind them.",
"Positively, would be like having an interactive journal and reactions ","I think it has alot of potential, but wouldn't want it to replace real human interaction ",I would be intrigued to see how using the app affects my thinking
Niether makes no difference to me,Fun timepass entertainment not real machine automated,
From a guidance point of view then I think the Replika chatbot could have a positive impact i.e. if you were looking for what would be another person's perspective on an issue without actually talking to a human being.  It would have a negative impact on me if I became to reliant on the Replika chatbot and reduced my interactions with humans. I would like to try the chatbot but I'm not sure it's something I would use on a regular basis. ,I suppose it would boil down to how lonely or in need of companionship you actually were and whether talking to a chatbot would be better than not having anyone to talk to. ,I feel there are definitely pros and cons for chatbots so it will be interesting to see how 'big' they become. 
I think Replika would impact me in a negative way. I don't trust sites like that. And I don't like speaking to people whom I don't know online.,i don't agree with them. as I said I do not trust sites like this,no
"Useful for tasks, but otherwise just feels like a fad",They're not real relationships at all and shouldn't be sold as such,No
Somewhat Positively in a way ,"I think it's odd to have a relationship with a chat box, it can be fine to have a comfort their as a friend, but to take it beyond that is concerning ","I think it can be good if someone mabey struggling to meet friends or make friends, but I find it harmful to thoes health an minds of people wanting relationships with it beyond that as a romantic partner "
If I had a question I did not want to ask a human maybe it would help to ask chatbot out of curiousity ,I think it is a bit strange and weird. They are programmed for a response so the answer is not organic,No
"im single dont have many friends it might be a friend or someone to chat with might be good fun, or might just be waist of time or be something your addicted too.","no sure about it to be honest, i think there will be possitive things as a partner if it answers way you hoped it would butt then it might not be real saying wrong things not something you can touch feel",not really i might have a look.
If it was similar to google assitant or Alexa i wouldnt see th harm but if it was to become more human like or more human like and aware of itself people would depend on it more and more and treat it like a human. This would be very harmful as social interactions would stop as people would rely more on AI rather than real conversations and interactions. ,They are useful to some degress as i use Alexa myself as I'm disabled. I use that to switch plugs on and off but i wouldn't feel comfortable having a conversation with it,I think I've covered everything
"I think it will impact positively as even if is a computer talking to us, it might feel like we are talking to someone.",I think is a good app to be used for someone that might don't have anyone to talk ,
I do not think I would value or enjoy using this as I would be aware that I am not speaking to a human and therefore the responses would not be natural. ,They are definitely not for me but I wouldn’t be against them on the whole,No
"I don't really think it would be either a positive or negative experience. I believe that I would pereive replica as a way of procrastinating and wastin a little time whilst I'm waiting to do something. Although, I do believe that some people could have the capacity to lose themselves in the app depending upon how lifelike it can become","I think they could be a good idea to pass time and perhaps help peoples social skills. As AI develops, I could see them becoming a dangerous tool, esoecially if they can beome sentient",They seem like theyre for lonely people
I think I would not consider Replika as a real friend/human and will be giving up using the app in a short period,It could be good if it doesn't look too much like AI with only standard responses,
"If using it as a sole friend/contact I think it would be dangerous, but using for say motivational support may be positive","Nothing replaces a human to me, and I am not ready for this approach.",no
It wouldn't affect me as I have family and friends. I don't think I would use it very often at all. It may start as positive but it would become negative over time. ,They are good for some people that are very lonely and have no family and friends as at least they could have the feeling that someone loves/cares for them. ,We are all spending too much time online and need to connect much more with offline experiences. 
"I think it could be a useful resource if I had a problem or situation that, for whatever reason,  I felt needed a response from someone that wouldn't be emotionally impacted by the discussion as I worry about upsetting people or making them uncomfortable, sometimes, by expressing emotions that I need to work through. As such a resource, I think it would impact me positively.  I don't think it's a substitute for real interactions, though, and although I very much doubt I would use one much, if I did and came to rely on AI as my primary means of emotional support, I think it would adversely impact my relationships with other people.","I think they can have their place as long as they are used as a tool to self-awareness and working through of problems, but the concept is open to abuse and that over-reliance on such AI could have an extremely harmful effect on certain people.","AI is only as good as those who program it, and in a world where people's reliance on technology is becoming ever more unquestioning, perhaps there should be some areas of life that are *not* subject to it. "
"Possibly positively for a short term in a crisis, however it would impact me negatively in the long term with continued use. ",Uncomfortable as they are not real. It seems risky.,"Would need to know a huge amount more about safety, data use and similar."
I feel it would be a distraction that would have a negative impact on my busy life,i imagine its good if you are lonely and crave human contact,
If I became too dependent on Replika it would have negative implications on my social intelligence and I wouldn’t feel the need to interact with other humans ,I think they are very harmful as it disincentivises people from making human relationships ,N/A
Positively for keeping reminders etc. Negatively for social interaction. ,I think it's important to have human interaction more than find companionship with an AI. ,"While the app may interact in a convincing way, I think interacting with humans is a better system. "
It would make me a better communicator because I can practice conversations,They can become too involving if you come to depend on it for emotional support ,No
I feel it may impact my decisions on daily chores in a positive way,I think they may be helpful for people who spend a lot of time on their own,no
It would be good for self esteem and maybe planning but might not be too good at more personal things,Good for companionship but not for relationship as I think replika doesn't really have any feelings,It could be very useful for very lonely people 
"I've interacted with enough chatbots and AI software to not let it impact me much. Partly for that reason, I wouldn't spend much time interacting with it, so there wouldn't be much of a positive or negative impact.","There are definite uses for such devices, in cases where people have specific communication or companionship needs. Personally I wouldn't be able to get past the knowledge that it's a computer program owned by a corporation, with all the inbuilt biases that come with such ownership. I'd rather interact with real humans if at all possible.","There are many things AI can help us with. Science appears to be trying to use it to replace many of the things that make life worth living (friendship, art creation, writing creation). I'd rather we had AI to do our taxes and clean our hallway!"
Neutral as I don't find value in it,Relationship with them arent real. They are the same as an imaginary friend,no
Nither I would use it knowing it was a computer AI program.,I have no real interest in them as I would know they are just BOTS and both would be the same to me ,AI is ok but people ask things of these that they cannot answer and just get people annoyed
Negatively as it would not be a true relationship and I would essentially be talking to a machine. I do not think this is a healthy or natural thing to do.,That it is completely unnatural and not healthy for anyone. I could see many mental health issues arising from this.,I think chat bots should only be used light-heartedly and not as a serious thing. 
"I think it would affect me negatively because it would never come up with a satisfactory answer if something was wrong, and I'd never be happy with the quality of the conversation. It'd be like a partner who never listens.","Such mixed feelings. Generally I think of chatbots as not being real enough so they can't answer your questions (e.g. if you contact a customer services chatbot, they can only answer questions that are already in the FAQ and can't find anything further out). But if they were too real, I'd be really freaked out and would wonder if a real person was listening in somewhere and typing the answers.",
"I could perhaps gain some helpful tips from it about how to deal with some situations in my life or how to plan out a plan of action or such. This would be definitely helpful if it help out. On the other hand, using it more and more often would probably lead to me wasting more time, instead of concentrating on more important, real-life things","I think they can be useful with providing advice, help or suggestions but since they are still a bunch of 0s and 1s still, I just don't care about it as much, especially in terms of actual relationships, as they would all feel artificial and fake. I guess being able to have an actual intelligent and realistic conversations about specific topics like computing, chemistry etc. could be useful and great.","No, all good"
"I don't think I would be comfortable using it, so it would have little impact. At a push it seems negative to have a fake relationship with an AI.",I think they are harmful as it's only a pretend relationship.,no
I am not sure.... possibly that'd be a neutral experience.,They have no emaotions to really feel what we think about a give situation. But maybe they can be helpful.,"No, thanks."
If I used it it would have a highly negative impact as it would encourage me to engage in soulless conversations and avoid real ones. ,"I think that they are no where near convincing enough to have any use but there is potential if the technology ever gets good enough to simulate even a fraction of the human mind, which it currently cannot do. ",
neutral. they can be a help but have no real substance or personality,I wouldn't say no to it but it wouldn't be on the top of my list of things to do ,no
"To be honest, I think a little bit of both. Maybe it could help me practice some idle chit chat especially if the chatbot pretended to be a romantic partner, but I think overall I would feel a bit pathetic talking to a robot rather than a real person. I think my self esteem would be reduced. I can absolutely see the logic and potential for some people, especially those who are lonely, but I just don't think it would suit me personally.","Again, I can absolutely see how they could be of great benefit to some, but to me personally, I think it could be somewhat damaging. Each to his own, so I certainly wouldn't judge those who feel it helps them in some way.",Nothing else thanks. Hope I helped.
I think woukd decrease social interaction.,I would not use them. I would rather talk to people ,No
Positively by providing friend advice when I feel like I've exhausted them. Negatively by obtaining private information about me that I wouldn't necessarily put on the internet otherwise,I would be more open to a companion chatbot than a relationship chatbot. Relationship chatbot would be too intimate,no
i dont think having a fake friend would be good for me,theyre a little strange but they help people who are lonely,no
I think it would impact with me in a positive way.,"I personally think its not a thing for me, but i can kinda understand why some people would want to use it. Some people could be lonely and want a companion, and who am i to judge.",nothing to come to mind.
I think the chat bot would be something they could be all consuming to some users. I personally would see myself not being highly engaged and unattached. ,I think they are something that humans can form unhealthy attachments to. ,Nope!
I think it could give me some social aspect positively but negatively it could isolate me from other humans and interactions,It can be a slippery slope to being isolated and dependent on chatbots,Chatbots aren’t really for me. I wouldn’t use it
I think it would be a negative impact because it’s not real life. ,I think it’s creepy and does not help anyone with finding real meaningful relationships ,No
"I don't think I would personally get much out of trying to build a relationship with it. It could be useful for performing specific tasks though - reviewing a resume or helping to craft a letter, for example.","I imagine there may be some sort of a market for them, but I don't personally see it as a viable replacement for human friendship and interaction.",I first learned about Replika on TV - I believe it was a Lisa Ling documentary style show. It was fascinating to learn how attached some users can become.
Positively because I can practice conversations and how to interact in social situations.,It is an interesting way to interact and learn social interactions but there are many elements missing from real conversations despite that it cuts really close to reality.,No.
"I can imagine the utility of having a source of information, and interaction if the source references used by the AI were credible and proven to have a high degree of accuracy. that would be positive","I think they currently appear interesting, engaging, and pique my curiosity for their ultimate potential",I'm unsure of the definition of consciousness in AI. It is a deep philosophical argument
"I think that it wouldn't impact me much because I wouldn't be too interested or invested in it, honestly. It's not a real person. ",I think they're kind of weird but they're fine I guess for the most part because they show an advancement in technology. ,Nope! :)
I might feel like it’s real and wish my other relationships were like that. ,It’s not real and the expectation it would force me to have on the outside world wouldn’t be good. ,Nope
I think the Replika would be a somewhat harmful substitute for conversations with real people. ,"I think they may help people that are lonely, but people should still try to develop relationships with real humans. ",Nope
"I think I would eventually rely on it too much, so it would be negative","I think it's a sweet sentiment for people that don't have anyone that they can talk to, but there's a fine line that can be crossed between those using it for a bit of companionship and people who are relying on it too much",no
It would give me something to do that simulates social interaction ,I have no strong or specific feelings about the matter one way or the other. ,
I think it would impact me negatively.,I think developing a relationship that you take seriously with Replika would be harmful for your social relationship with real people. ,No
positively. i need social interaction and itd be a start,"they cant hurt. and since were so consumed by technology and less social in real life and less connected, its something",
I think it would be nice to bounce things off 'someone' without later feeling regret,"I don't know how good the advice they give is.  But, it seems like it could be helpful.",Nice to have a companion on demand.
"Positively,I would have a friend.",No I wouldn’t.I would like to have a friend.someone to talk to.,No
"Negatively. I would want to interact with my friends and family and the world more, so turning to a chatbot for my social needs would impact the relationships I could develop with other people in the real world.","I think they could be helpful for practicing conversations when people are anxious, but they need to be used moderately so people are using chatbots to replace something in their real world life that they would need for social development.",
"I do not think it would impact me positively or negatively, as I do not think it would be very useful for me.","I think they could have a limited use for some people, but cannot provide replacement for human relationships.",
"I think it could be positive to have ""someone"" to talk to and be able to ask questions of.  However, I think overall, it would be detrimental to become dependent on an AI.  I think it could negatively impact my relationships with humans.","I think casual relationships with AI would be fine, especially if they can be used to aid in work or education.  However, I do not think that building an actual ""relationship"" with an AI would be healthy or truly helpful in the long run.","I think AI has great potential for helping us, however, I think we need to be careful in how we go about creating and utilizing them."
positive if it gave good suggestions but negatively if used for personal interaction instead of real contact,Not good for society because it would cause a lack of true meaningful  relationships ,
I feel like it may be a bad replacement for real human interaction. There are certainly some interesting things that can be done but I don't think there would be that much positively. Perhaps I just see past the curtain too much and find it completely artificial and disingenuous ,I generally have no problem if people have relationships because we obviously have relationships with much sillier things. Putting too much stock or emotion into it may be problematic though,no
"I think the chatbot would impact me positively, by giving me a way to talk things out and figure out things from a difference perspective. However, I also think it would be negative for me because I know I can become lost in that type of world and start to think of that as reality and leave behind my ""real"" life. So I think it would be good on a moderate basis but in now way should I be talking to a bot on an every day, multiple times of day basis. ",I think they are good in some respects and bad in others. My previous response is exactly why they can be both. It could help tons of people who are house bound or in need of someone to talk to so in that respect it is great. But I also think people would end up believing in this AI type of life and its not real so believing in it could be damaging. ,Thanks for the opportunity! 
"I'd say positively. It's very therapeutic to journal your thoughts and feelings. Having someone there that at least mimics compassion and understanding to those things can be very helpful. I think in many ways, some clients would feel their actual therapist simply mimics compassion and understanding as well.","I think they have a lot of potential to help people and to create an environment that is positive and nurturing, while helping people feel less alone. I also feel like with any kind of relationship, people may become too attached and maybe attracted to their Replika which could cause some issues.","Sure! If you like art or anything like that, I create it and sell it."
I don't think it would impact me either way. Taliking to an artificial app would not have any reality for me. ,not a good thing to relplace real relationships with a made up one.  Kind of makes me wonder if subtle infuences could be programed  to influence you without knowing,Worrisome thinking that individuals could get attached to such a thing .  It would be a deviation from realiy.
I would be negative as it would be better to develop real relationships,I think they might help lonely people. But ultimately I don’t think they are beneficially to most.,
"If I used the chatbot, I think it would impact me positively. I would probably only use it as an alternate google or alexa to ask it ordinary questions that it could easily answer. I can't see myself using it for anything beyond that.","I don't think the technology for it has reached the point where companion chatbots will be widely used. I may not know enough about them, but I don't know anyone within my circle that use them or have even thought about using them.",
I wouldn't have the time for it. I hear you need to 'level' it up to get anywhere fun with the chat bot,I think they're boring. I used to use chat bots in middle school that were entertaining but it just seems like a fad.,n/a
"Negatively, it would make it too easy to withdrawal into yourself. ",I think it should only be used for entertainment. ,It could possibly help someone to become better at interacting with others.
I think it would be creepy for me. I have no use of an extra person to open up to during the day. I would also be wary f what kind of marketable personal data that could be stored and shared. I imagine there are some people who it may be useful for in a therapeutic setting.,Not for me. I am concerned that the data collected could be marketed to advertisers. I also have no use for an extra personal companion.,"No, thank you."
it would creep me out. this is negative,"i think they are weird and a bit sad, honestly. that is all i have to say about that.",no thanks
Negatively. I would become too dependent on it.,They are artificial. I seem them slightly more lifelike than my google assistant. Not much more.,AI is scary to me if they become too life like.
"If it was useful, it would be positive, if it was just entertainment, I would probably lose interest quickly.","I love the idea, it's nice to talk to someone, even if it's just a bot who has any idea what I'm talking about.",No.
Negatively. It would distract me from real interactions with people. ,I think they are pretty harmful. They distract from the real world and push people to get advice from AI and not human wisdom. ,
Overall negatively; it would distract me from growing relationships with real humans,I think they’re not a good alternative to human relationships,No
I think it could give helpful advice and that is what I would use it for. A resource. But not develop feelings for it like a human who lives and breaths.,I think it's good for people who can't have normal social interaction or romantic interaction but crave that basic need.,I think the tech is great and it is the future - I'm curious to see what it becomes
I think that would depend on how it had been programmed.,"I think it’s interesting and, like many things, could be a positive or a negative thing. It seems that there could be many variables which could shape potential interactions.",The thought of this really makes you think. 
I think it would impact me negatively if I used it a lot because I might become reliant on it and not interact with actual people.,"I think they can be good for small things, but not good if used as a romantic partner or a friend.",No
It will impact me positively because it will make my activities much easier,,
